A CodeIgniter Library to integrate javascript toastr

Have you ever been in a situation that you need to send timed notifications to your client view, notifications that you want to expire within a certain period of time.

PHP(Codeigniter) allows that feature by flashing messages to the session but in most cases, the issue is to display such messages in a fashionable and user friendly way. Wooooh I got you on this. XD

Example Scenario: You only just want to display the message with custom colors pertaining to each message This library will help you in runing such query in a very easy to use interface.

Requirements
PHP >= 5.2
CodeIgniter Application
Valid loading of the session library
Installation
The easiest way to install this is to clone the repo in your local disk. Then copy the src/Toaster.php file in your application/libraries Folder.

You can then load it like any other library

$this->load->library('toastr');
Or if you are using composer run

composer require joshuachinemezu/ci-toastr

Create a file in your application/views folder and name it "alert.php". Paste the following code in it.

    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/toastr.js/latest/js/toastr.min.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/toastr.js/latest/css/toastr.min.css">


    <script type="text/javascript">


    <?php if ($this->session->flashdata('success')) {?>
        toastr.success("<?php echo $this->session->flashdata('success'); ?>");
    <?php } else if ($this->session->flashdata('error')) {?>
        toastr.error("<?php echo $this->session->flashdata('error'); ?>");
    <?php } else if ($this->session->flashdata('warning')) {?>
        toastr.warning("<?php echo $this->session->flashdata('warning'); ?>");
    <?php } else if ($this->session->flashdata('info')) {?>
        toastr.info("<?php echo $this->session->flashdata('info'); ?>");
    <?php }?>


    </script>
Ooooh it's getting complicated right? Don't worry one more step and we are done here

Create another file in your application/views folder and name it flash.php (Just for consistency but you can name it anything if you know your way around here). Paste the code below in it

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <!-- <title>My Pages for Alert</title> -->
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/3.2.1/css/font-awesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    </head>
    <body>


    <div>
    <?php
    $this->load->view('alert');
    ?>
    </div>


    </body>
    </html>
Yeah we are through with installation. lol

In your controller after a task is completed, you can use any of the codes below in regards to the code flow

-- for successful message

    $this->toastr->success('Your account was created successfully');
